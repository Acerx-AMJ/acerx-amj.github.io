         <h1>About</h1>
         <p><span></span>I have experience with low level languages and DoD, as well as foundational skills for Arduino and web development. My favorite types of projects are games and interpreters and I like to work on projects from embedded systems to simple websites. I do this for my love for programming and I mostly code with C/C++, but occasionally also use Java or Javascript. The programming language does not matter to me and I'm really flexible and can learn new technologies easily.</p>
         <p><span></span>My coding journey began somewhere in the start of summer 2024, when I made my first web game using Javascript. Sadly, I didn't save it and everything about it is lost. In the end of August I picked up C++ and started making small terminal games and learned new things quickly. After a while the terminal got boring and I moved on and started making games with SFML library, I remember how hard it was for me at the time, but I kept doing it and eventually made my first real game - Pong. It felt amazing and right after moved to bigger and bigger games. At some point I decided to switch to Raylib and it was an amazing experience. Since then, I've made a lot of micro-projects and games like <a href="../projects/block_placer.html">Block Placer</a> and <a href="../projects/sandbox2d.html">Sandbox-2D</a>.</p>
         <p><span></span>I made this website as a personal portfolio and project showcase, as well as to start writing blogs, as I've been journaling for some time now. Only I have access to write blogs, which go over topics of my interest and new updates for any of my projects. The blogs are accessible to anyone to read and subscribe to free of charge or advertisements.
