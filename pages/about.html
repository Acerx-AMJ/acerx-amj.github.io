         <h2>About</h2>
         <p><span></span>I'm Daniel - a low-level programmer and game developer. My favorite types of projects are games and I like to work on projects from embedded systems to simple websites. I mostly code with C/C++ and I love what I do.</p>
         <p><span></span>I primarily work in VS Code on Linux or in Visual Studio on Windows and I know how to use tools like Git, Perf and Valgrind. I'm really flexible and can learn new technologies easily.</p>
         <p><span></span>Outside of coding I enjoy taking walks and experimenting with electronics. I don't know much yet, but it's super fun to do.</p>
         <p><span></span>The goal behind this website was to create a personal portfolio and a blog. Since I like to journal, I've been wanting to expand it and write blogs as well. Only I have access to write and edit blogs. They go over my interests, opinions and updates on projects. My blogs are accessible to anyone free of charge or advertisements.</p>
         <p><span></span>My website is open-source on <a href="https://github.com/Acerx-AMJ/acerx-amj.github.io">Github</a> and it is licensed under MIT License. All blogs are licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>.</p></p>
