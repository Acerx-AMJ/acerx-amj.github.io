         <h3 class="my-5 text-heading text-3xl text-zinc-50 font-bold">About</h3>
         <p class="text-body text-zinc-50"><span style="margin-left:20px"></span>Sandbox-2D is a sandbox survival game where the player can build, survive or simply play around. It is a 2D fantasy sidescrolling tile game.</p>

         <h3 class="my-5 text-heading text-3xl text-zinc-50 font-bold">Features</h3>
         <p class="text-body text-zinc-50"><span style="margin-left:20px"></span>Sandbox-2D has features too many to name. But I'll still list some of the bigger ones. First, world generation featuring a variety of biomes based on temperature and humidity. Each world is different and there's also an option to generate a flat world. Second, player controller - the player can move around, interact with the environment and get hurt by different hazards. The player also has the ability to break and place blocks.</p>
         <p class="text-body text-zinc-50"><span style="margin-left:20px"></span>There are also a lot of features under physics and the renderer. The game handles sand, dirt and liquid physics. And the game handles 4 layers: background, furniture, liquids and blocks. Each layer interacts with the player or the other layers and are interconnected.</p>
 
         <h3 class="my-5 text-heading text-3xl text-zinc-50 font-bold">Development</h3>
         <p class="text-body text-zinc-50"><span style="margin-left:20px"></span>I made Sandbox-2D with C++ and Raylib and my primary goal was to learn how to structure and design a big game. While I'll rather classify this as a medium-scale project, I still think it has taught me everything I wanted and even more. I learned DoD and simple design and no other project has taught me as much as this one. I started working on Sandbox-2D on November 8th and I'm still doing so to this day.</p>
         <p class="text-body text-zinc-50"><span style="margin-left:20px"></span>I've used Git since day one so all commit history is available at <a class="my-3 font-medium text-sky-400 hover:underline" href="https://github.com/Acerx-AMJ/Sandbox-2D/commits/main/">Github</a>. I've tried to implement the simplest thing I could and then slowly add features to it and in the gallery I posted pictures in a chronological order so it's easier to see the big changes I've made to the game. I'm really proud about the state it's in right now and it's the biggest project I've ever made. If I had to start fresh then I'd try to make the code even simpler than it is right now.</p>
