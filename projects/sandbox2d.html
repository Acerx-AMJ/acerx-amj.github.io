      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>I made Sandbox-2D with C++ and Raylib and during the creation of this project I learned DoD and simplistic design. No other project has taught me as much as this one. I truly love making it and it'll forever stay in my memory. It also helped me hone my pixel art skills, as I needed to create the entirety of pixel art myself from the 8x8 blocks to the 256x144 backgrounds.</p>

      <h3>Features</h3>
      <p>On the lower level Sandbox-2D has features like state handler, resource and sound, and particle managers and a lot of different UI element handlers for buttons, progress bars and such.</p>
      <p>But gameplay wise it features world generation, world management, player controller, lighting and liquid systems, furniture system and survival mode.</p>
      <p>Feature wise this is my biggest project to this point, it includes things I've never done before and it was truly an amazing learning experience. I have gone a really long way in the short time I've been making it and I still have a lot to add and I have much more to learn from this project.</p>

      <h3>Play</h3>
      <p>The game is available completely for free on Windows, Linux and MacOS. It is also open-source and licensed under the MIT License.</p>
