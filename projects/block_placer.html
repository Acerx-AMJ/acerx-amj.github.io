         <h2>About</h2>
         <p><span></span>Block Placer is a game heavily inspired by Tetris. It is made with C++ and Raylib and I used this project to transition from using SFML to Raylib. It served its purpose well and I learned the foundations of Raylib. I found that Raylib is way easier to use than SFML and just as useful if not more. This is a great project for a beginner to make as it teaches a lot about game design and logic.</p>

         <h2>Features</h2>
         <p><span></span>Different game states are handled with a state handler. Unlike most Tetris clones, this one features 3 playable modes - solo, co-op and versus. This is what I'm most proud of. In co-op mode you can play with a friend on a larger map or challenge yourself to control two tetrominoes at the same time - both are extremely fun to do! But if you're more on the competitive side then you can challenge your friends in versus.</p>
         <p><span></span></p>
         <p><span></span>Playing with friends is really fun, but you can't always do it on a single machine like this game requires. That's why I might come back to this in the future and learn how to implement networking to let players play with each other around the world.</p>

         <h2>Play</h2>
         <p><span></span>The game is available completely for free on Linux and MacOS on <a href="https://acerxamj.itch.io/block-placer">Itch.io</a>. It is open-source and available on <a href="https://github.com/Acerx-AMJ/block_placer">Github</a> under MIT License.</p>
